# ðŸ”¥ WARNING ðŸ”¥ Deprecated

## Use [query-string-for-all](https://github.com/cdeutsch/query-string-for-all) instead.

`query-string-for-all` has a better name, has been synced with the latest version of `query-string`, and has been updated to not pull in other ES6 modules like `strict-uri-encode`
